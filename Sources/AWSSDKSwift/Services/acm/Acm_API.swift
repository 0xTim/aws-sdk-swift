For more information about importing certificates into ACM, including the differences between certificates that you import and those that ACM provides, see Importing Certificates in the AWS Certificate Manager User Guide. To import a certificate, you must provide the certificate and the matching private key. When the certificate is not self-signed, you must also provide a certificate chain. You can omit the certificate chain when importing a self-signed certificate. The certificate, private key, and certificate chain must be PEM-encoded. For more information about converting these items to PEM format, see Importing Certificates Troubleshooting in the AWS Certificate Manager User Guide.

Similarly, you can apply the same tag to multiple resources if you want to specify a relationship among those resources. For example, you can add the same tag to an ACM Certificate and an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer to indicate that they are both used by the same website.
