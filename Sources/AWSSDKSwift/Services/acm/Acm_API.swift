    ///  Imports a certificate into AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to use with services that are integrated with ACM. For more information, see Integrated Services.   ACM does not provide managed renewal for certificates that you import.  For more information about importing certificates into ACM, including the differences between certificates that you import and those that ACM provides, see Importing Certificates in the AWS Certificate Manager User Guide.  In general, you can import almost any valid certificate. However, services integrated with ACM allow only certificate types they support to be associated with their resources. The following guidelines are also important:   You must enter the private key that matches the certificate you are importing.   The private key must be unencrypted. You cannot import a private key that is protected by a password or a passphrase.   If the certificate you are importing is not self-signed, you must enter its certificate chain.   If a certificate chain is included, the issuer must be the subject of one of the certificates in the chain.   The certificate, private key, and certificate chain must be PEM-encoded.   The current time must be between the Not Before and Not After certificate fields.   The Issuer field must not be empty.   The OCSP authority URL must not exceed 1000 characters.   To import a new certificate, omit the CertificateArn field. Include this field only when you want to replace a previously imported certificate.   When you import a certificate by using the CLI or one of the SDKs, you must specify the certificate, certificate chain, and private key parameters as file names preceded by file://. For example, you can specify a certificate saved in the C:\temp folder as C:\temp\certificate_to_import.pem. If you are making an HTTP or HTTPS Query request, include these parameters as BLOBs.    This operation returns the Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the imported certificate.

For each domain name you specify, email is sent to the domain owner to request approval to issue the certificate. Email is sent to three registered contact addresses in the WHOIS database and to five common system administration addresses formed from the DomainName you enter or the optional ValidationDomain parameter. For more information, see Validate Domain Ownership.  After receiving approval from the domain owner, the ACM Certificate is issued. For more information, see the AWS Certificate Manager User Guide.

You can apply a tag to just one certificate if you want to identify a specific characteristic of that certificate, or you can apply the same tag to multiple certificates if you want to filter for a common relationship among those certificates. Similarly, you can apply the same tag to multiple resources if you want to specify a relationship among those resources. For example, you can add the same tag to an ACM Certificate and an Elastic Load Balancing load balancer to indicate that they are both used by the same website. For more information, see Tagging ACM Certificates.  To remove one or more tags, use the RemoveTagsFromCertificate action. To view all of the tags that have been applied to the certificate, use the ListTagsForCertificate action.

Therefore, if you do not receive the original mail, you can request that the mail be resent within 72 hours of requesting the ACM Certificate. If more than 72 hours have elapsed since your original request or since your last attempt to resend validation mail, you must request a new certificate.
