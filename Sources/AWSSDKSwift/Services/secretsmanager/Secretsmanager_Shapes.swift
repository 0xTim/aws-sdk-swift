To use this parameter in the command-line tools, we recommend that you store your binary data in a file and then use the appropriate technique for your tool to pass the contents of the file as a parameter. Either SecretString or SecretBinary must have a value, but not both. They cannot both be empty. This parameter is not available using the Secrets Manager console.

You can specify any of the supported ways to identify a AWS KMS key ID. If you need to reference a CMK in a different account, you can use only the key ARN or the alias ARN. If you don't specify this value, then Secrets Manager defaults to using the AWS account's default CMK (the one named aws/secretsmanager). If a AWS KMS CMK with that name doesn't yet exist, then Secrets Manager creates it for you automatically the first time it needs to encrypt a version's SecretString or SecretBinary fields.  You can use the account's default CMK to encrypt and decrypt only if you call this operation using credentials from the same account that owns the secret. If the secret is in a different account, then you must create a custom CMK and specify the ARN in this field.

If you use the AWS CLI or one of the AWS SDK to call this operation, then you can leave this parameter empty. The CLI or SDK generates a random UUID for you and includes it as the value for this parameter in the request. If you don't use the SDK and instead generate a raw HTTP request to the Secrets Manager service endpoint, then you must generate a ClientRequestToken yourself for the new version and include that value in the request.  This value helps ensure idempotency. Secrets Manager uses this value to prevent the accidental creation of duplicate versions if there are failures and retries during a rotation. We recommend that you generate a UUID-type value to ensure uniqueness of your versions within the specified secret.    If the ClientRequestToken value isn't already associated with a version of the secret then a new version of the secret is created.    If a version with this value already exists and that version's SecretString and SecretBinary values are the same as those in the request, then the request is ignored (the operation is idempotent).   If a version with this value already exists and that version's SecretString and SecretBinary values are different from those in the request then the request fails because you cannot modify an existing version. Instead, use PutSecretValue to create a new version.   This value becomes the SecretVersionId of the new version.

This operation only appends tags to the existing list of tags. To remove tags, you must use UntagResource.    Secrets Manager tag key names are case sensitive. A tag with the key "ABC" is a different tag from one with key "abc".   If you check tags in IAM policy Condition elements as part of your security strategy, then adding or removing a tag can change permissions. If the successful completion of this operation would result in you losing your permissions for this secret, then this operation is blocked and returns an Access Denied error.    This parameter requires a JSON text string argument. For information on how to format a JSON parameter for the various command line tool environments, see Using JSON for Parameters in the AWS CLI User Guide. For example:  [{"Key":"CostCenter","Value":"12345"},{"Key":"environment","Value":"production"}]  If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the double quotes required in the JSON text.  The following basic restrictions apply to tags:   Maximum number of tags per secret—50   Maximum key length—127 Unicode characters in UTF-8   Maximum value length—255 Unicode characters in UTF-8   Tag keys and values are case sensitive.   Do not use the aws: prefix in your tag names or values because it is reserved for AWS use. You can't edit or delete tag names or values with this prefix. Tags with this prefix do not count against your tags per secret limit.   If your tagging schema will be used across multiple services and resources, remember that other services might have restrictions on allowed characters. Generally allowed characters are: letters, spaces, and numbers representable in UTF-8, plus the following special characters: + - = . _ : / @.

For example:  [{"username":"bob"},{"password":"abc123xyz456"}]  If your command-line tool or SDK requires quotation marks around the parameter, you should use single quotes to avoid confusion with the double quotes required in the JSON text.
