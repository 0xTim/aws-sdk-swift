"mapr-m5" - launch the cluster using MapR M5 Edition.   "mapr" with the user arguments specifying "--edition,m3" or "--edition,m5" - launch the job flow using MapR M3 or M5 Edition respectively.   "mapr-m7" - launch the cluster using MapR M7 Edition.   "hunk" - launch the cluster with the Hunk Big Data Analtics Platform.   "hue"- launch the cluster with Hue installed.   "spark" - launch the cluster with Apache Spark installed.   "ganglia" - launch the cluster with the Ganglia Monitoring System installed.
