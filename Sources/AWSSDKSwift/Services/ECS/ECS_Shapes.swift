If the network mode is set to none, you cannot specify port mappings in your container definitions, and the tasks containers do not have external connectivity. The host and awsvpc network modes offer the highest networking performance for containers because they use the EC2 network stack instead of the virtualized network stack provided by the bridge mode. With the host and awsvpc network modes, exposed container ports are mapped directly to the corresponding host port (for the host network mode) or the attached elastic network interface port (for the awsvpc network mode), so you cannot take advantage of dynamic host port mappings.  If the network mode is awsvpc, the task is allocated an elastic network interface, and you must specify a NetworkConfiguration value when you create a service or run a task with the task definition. For more information, see Task Networking in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.  Currently, only Amazon ECS-optimized AMIs, other Amazon Linux variants with the ecs-init package, or AWS Fargate infrastructure support the awsvpc network mode.   If the network mode is host, you cannot run multiple instantiations of the same task on a single container instance when port mappings are used. Docker for Windows uses different network modes than Docker for Linux. When you register a task definition with Windows containers, you must not specify a network mode. If you use the console to register a task definition with Windows containers, you must choose the &lt;default&gt; network mode object.

This parameter maps to MemoryReservation in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --memory-reservation option to docker run. You must specify a non-zero integer for one or both of memory or memoryReservation in container definitions. If you specify both, memory must be greater than memoryReservation. If you specify memoryReservation, then that value is subtracted from the available memory resources for the container instance on which the container is placed. Otherwise, the value of memory is used. For example, if your container normally uses 128 MiB of memory, but occasionally bursts to 256 MiB of memory for short periods of time, you can set a memoryReservation of 128 MiB, and a memory hard limit of 300 MiB. This configuration would allow the container to only reserve 128 MiB of memory from the remaining resources on the container instance, but also allow the container to consume more memory resources when needed.

Port mappings on Windows use the NetNAT gateway address rather than localhost. There is no loopback for port mappings on Windows, so you cannot access a container's mapped port from the host itself.  This parameter maps to PortBindings in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --publish option to docker run. If the network mode of a task definition is set to none, then you can't specify port mappings.

However the container may use a different logging driver than the Docker daemon by specifying a log driver with this parameter in the container definition. To use a different logging driver for a container, the log system must be configured properly on the container instance (or on a different log server for remote logging options). For more information on the options for different supported log drivers, see Configure logging drivers in the Docker documentation.  Amazon ECS currently supports a subset of the logging drivers available to the Docker daemon (shown in the LogConfiguration data type).

This parameter maps to Image in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the IMAGE parameter of docker run.   When a new task starts, the Amazon ECS container agent pulls the latest version of the specified image and tag for the container to use. However, subsequent updates to a repository image are not propagated to already running tasks.   Images in Amazon ECR repositories can be specified by either using the full registry/repository:tag or registry/repository@digest. For example, 012345678910.dkr.ecr.&lt;region-name&gt;.amazonaws.com/&lt;repository-name&gt;:latest or 012345678910.dkr.ecr.&lt;region-name&gt;.amazonaws.com/&lt;repository-name&gt;@sha256:94afd1f2e64d908bc90dbca0035a5b567EXAMPLE.    Images in official repositories on Docker Hub use a single name (for example, ubuntu or mongo).   Images in other repositories on Docker Hub are qualified with an organization name (for example, amazon/amazon-ecs-agent).   Images in other online repositories are qualified further by a domain name (for example, quay.io/assemblyline/ubuntu).  
        public let image: String?
        /// When this parameter is true, the container is given elevated privileges on the host container instance (similar to the root user). This parameter maps to Privileged in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --privileged option to docker run.  This parameter is not supported for Windows containers or tasks using the Fargate launch type. 
        public let privileged: Bool?
        /// The working directory in which to run commands inside the container. This parameter maps to WorkingDir in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --workdir option to docker run.
        public let workingDirectory: String?
        /// The number of cpu units reserved for the container. This parameter maps to CpuShares in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --cpu-shares option to docker run. This field is optional for tasks using the Fargate launch type, and the only requirement is that the total amount of CPU reserved for all containers within a task be lower than the task-level cpu value.  You can determine the number of CPU units that are available per EC2 instance type by multiplying the vCPUs listed for that instance type on the Amazon EC2 Instances detail page by 1,024.  For example, if you run a single-container task on a single-core instance type with 512 CPU units specified for that container, and that is the only task running on the container instance, that container could use the full 1,024 CPU unit share at any given time. However, if you launched another copy of the same task on that container instance, each task would be guaranteed a minimum of 512 CPU units when needed, and each container could float to higher CPU usage if the other container was not using it, but if both tasks were 100% active all of the time, they would be limited to 512 CPU units. Linux containers share unallocated CPU units with other containers on the container instance with the same ratio as their allocated amount. For example, if you run a single-container task on a single-core instance type with 512 CPU units specified for that container, and that is the only task running on the container instance, that container could use the full 1,024 CPU unit share at any given time. However, if you launched another copy of the same task on that container instance, each task would be guaranteed a minimum of 512 CPU units when needed, and each container could float to higher CPU usage if the other container was not using it, but if both tasks were 100% active all of the time, they would be limited to 512 CPU units. On Linux container instances, the Docker daemon on the container instance uses the CPU value to calculate the relative CPU share ratios for running containers. For more information, see CPU share constraint in the Docker documentation. The minimum valid CPU share value that the Linux kernel allows is 2. However, the CPU parameter is not required, and you can use CPU values below 2 in your container definitions. For CPU values below 2 (including null), the behavior varies based on your Amazon ECS container agent version:    Agent versions less than or equal to 1.1.0: Null and zero CPU values are passed to Docker as 0, which Docker then converts to 1,024 CPU shares. CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 1, which the Linux kernel converts to two CPU shares.    Agent versions greater than or equal to 1.2.0: Null, zero, and CPU values of 1 are passed to Docker as 2.   On Windows container instances, the CPU limit is enforced as an absolute limit, or a quota. Windows containers only have access to the specified amount of CPU that is described in the task definition.
        public let cpu: Int32?
        /// The hard limit (in MiB) of memory to present to the container. If your container attempts to exceed the memory specified here, the container is killed. This parameter maps to Memory in the Create a container section of the Docker Remote API and the --memory option to docker run. If your containers are part of a task using the Fargate launch type, this field is optional and the only requirement is that the total amount of memory reserved for all containers within a task be lower than the task memory value. For containers that are part of a task using the EC2 launch type, you must specify a non-zero integer for one or both of memory or memoryReservation in container definitions. If you specify both, memory must be greater than memoryReservation. If you specify memoryReservation, then that value is subtracted from the available memory resources for the container instance on which the container is placed. Otherwise, the value of memory is used. The Docker daemon reserves a minimum of 4 MiB of memory for a container, so you should not specify fewer than 4 MiB of memory for your containers. 
        public let memory: Int32?

If this parameter is omitted, a container is assumed to be essential. All tasks must have at least one essential container.

If the service is using the ECS deployment controller, you are limited to one load balancer or target group. If the service is using the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller, the service is required to use either an Application Load Balancer or Network Load Balancer. When creating an AWS CodeDeploy deployment group, you specify two target groups (referred to as a targetGroupPair). During a deployment, AWS CodeDeploy determines which task set in your service has the status PRIMARY and associates one target group with it, and then associates the other target group with the replacement task set. The load balancer can also have up to two listeners: a required listener for production traffic and an optional listener that allows you perform validation tests with Lambda functions before routing production traffic to it. After you create a service using the ECS deployment controller, the load balancer name or target group ARN, container name, and container port specified in the service definition are immutable. If you are using the CODE_DEPLOY deployment controller, these values can be changed when updating the service. For Classic Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer name, the container name (as it appears in a container definition), and the container port to access from the load balancer. When a task from this service is placed on a container instance, the container instance is registered with the load balancer specified here. For Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers, this object must contain the load balancer target group ARN, the container name (as it appears in a container definition), and the container port to access from the load balancer. When a task from this service is placed on a container instance, the container instance and port combination is registered as a target in the target group specified here. Services with tasks that use the awsvpc network mode (for example, those with the Fargate launch type) only support Application Load Balancers and Network Load Balancers. Classic Load Balancers are not supported. Also, when you create any target groups for these services, you must choose ip as the target type, not instance, because tasks that use the awsvpc network mode are associated with an elastic network interface, not an Amazon EC2 instance.

If you specify the role parameter, you must also specify a load balancer object with the loadBalancers parameter.  If your account has already created the Amazon ECS service-linked role, that role is used by default for your service unless you specify a role here. The service-linked role is required if your task definition uses the awsvpc network mode, in which case you should not specify a role here.

DAEMON-The daemon scheduling strategy deploys exactly one task on each active container instance that meets all of the task placement constraints that you specify in your cluster. When you are using this strategy, there is no need to specify a desired number of tasks, a task placement strategy, or use Service Auto Scaling policies.

If the network mode is set to none, you cannot specify port mappings in your container definitions, and the tasks containers do not have external connectivity. The host and awsvpc network modes offer the highest networking performance for containers because they use the EC2 network stack instead of the virtualized network stack provided by the bridge mode. With the host and awsvpc network modes, exposed container ports are mapped directly to the corresponding host port (for the host network mode) or the attached elastic network interface port (for the awsvpc network mode), so you cannot take advantage of dynamic host port mappings.  If the network mode is awsvpc, the task is allocated an elastic network interface, and you must specify a NetworkConfiguration value when you create a service or run a task with the task definition. For more information, see Task Networking in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.  Currently, only Amazon ECS-optimized AMIs, other Amazon Linux variants with the ecs-init package, or AWS Fargate infrastructure support the awsvpc network mode.   If the network mode is host, you cannot run multiple instantiations of the same task on a single container instance when port mappings are used. Docker for Windows uses different network modes than Docker for Linux. When you register a task definition with Windows containers, you must not specify a network mode. If you use the console to register a task definition with Windows containers, you must choose the &lt;default&gt; network mode object.  For more information, see Network settings in the Docker run reference.

If none is specified, then IPC resources within the containers of a task are private and not shared with other containers in a task or on the container instance. If no value is specified, then the IPC resource namespace sharing depends on the Docker daemon setting on the container instance. For more information, see IPC settings in the Docker run reference. If the host IPC mode is used, be aware that there is a heightened risk of undesired IPC namespace expose. For more information, see Docker security. If you are setting namespaced kernel parameters using systemControls for the containers in the task, the following will apply to your IPC resource namespace. For more information, see System Controls in the Amazon Elastic Container Service Developer Guide.   For tasks that use the host IPC mode, IPC namespace related systemControls are not supported.
