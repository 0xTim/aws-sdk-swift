Amazon SageMaker launches the instance, installs common libraries that you can use to explore datasets for model training, and attaches an ML storage volume to the notebook instance.  Amazon SageMaker also provides a set of example notebooks. Each notebook demonstrates how to use Amazon SageMaker with a specific algorithm or with a machine learning framework.  After receiving the request, Amazon SageMaker does the following:   Creates a network interface in the Amazon SageMaker VPC.   (Option) If you specified SubnetId, Amazon SageMaker creates a network interface in your own VPC, which is inferred from the subnet ID that you provide in the input. When creating this network interface, Amazon SageMaker attaches the security group that you specified in the request to the network interface that it creates in your VPC.   Launches an EC2 instance of the type specified in the request in the Amazon SageMaker VPC. If you specified SubnetId of your VPC, Amazon SageMaker specifies both network interfaces when launching this instance. This enables inbound traffic from your own VPC to the notebook instance, assuming that the security groups allow it.   After creating the notebook instance, Amazon SageMaker returns its Amazon Resource Name (ARN). After Amazon SageMaker creates the notebook instance, you can connect to the Jupyter server and work in Jupyter notebooks.

HyperParameters - Specify these algorithm-specific parameters to influence the quality of the final model. For a list of hyperparameters for each training algorithm provided by Amazon SageMaker, see Algorithms.

Use this API to create a model only if you want to use Amazon SageMaker hosting services. To host your model, you create an endpoint configuration with the CreateEndpointConfig API, and then create an endpoint with the CreateEndpoint API.  Amazon SageMaker then deploys all of the containers that you defined for the model in the hosting environment.  In the CreateModel request, you must define a container with the PrimaryContainer parameter.  In the request, you also provide an IAM role that Amazon SageMaker can assume to access model artifacts and docker image for deployment on ML compute hosting instances. In addition, you also use the IAM role to manage permissions the inference code needs.

This includes the number and type of ML compute instances to deploy.  If you are hosting multiple models, you also assign a VariantWeight to specify how much traffic you want to allocate to each model.
