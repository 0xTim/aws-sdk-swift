If you want Amazon Kinesis Analytics to deliver data from an in-application stream within your application to an external destination (such as an Amazon Kinesis stream or a Firehose delivery stream), you add the relevant configuration to your application using this operation. You can configure one or more outputs for your application. Each output configuration maps an in-application stream and an external destination.  You can use one of the output configurations to deliver data from your in-application error stream to an external destination so that you can analyze the errors. For conceptual information, see Understanding Application Output (Destination).   Note that any configuration update, including adding a streaming source using this operation, results in a new version of the application. You can use the DescribeApplication operation to find the current application version. For the limits on the number of application inputs and outputs you can configure, see Limits.

    ///   Creates an Amazon Kinesis Analytics application. You can configure each application with one streaming source as input, application code to process the input, and up to five streaming destinations where you want Amazon Kinesis Analytics to write the output data from your application. For an overview, see How it Works.  In the input configuration, you map the streaming source to an in-application stream, which you can think of as a constantly updating table. In the mapping, you must provide a schema for the in-application stream and map each data column in the in-application stream to a data element in the streaming source, with the option of renaming, casting and dropping columns as desired. Your application code is one or more SQL statements that read input data, transform it, and generate output. Your application code can create one or more SQL artifacts like SQL streams or pumps. In the output configuration, you can configure the application to write data from in-application streams created in your applications to up to five streaming destinations.  To read data from your source stream or write data to destination streams, Amazon Kinesis Analytics needs your permissions. You grant these permissions by creating IAM roles. This operation requires permissions to perform the kinesisanalytics:CreateApplication action.   For introductory exercises to create an Amazon Kinesis Analytics application, see Getting Started.
