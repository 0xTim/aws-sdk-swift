For example, a user might utter an intent ("I want to order a pizza"). If Amazon Lex cannot infer the user intent from this utterance, it will return this dialogState.    ConfirmIntent - Amazon Lex is expecting a "yes" or "no" response.   For example, Amazon Lex wants user confirmation before fulfilling an intent.  Instead of a simple "yes" or "no," a user might respond with additional information. For example, "yes, but make it thick crust pizza" or "no, I want to order a drink". Amazon Lex can process such additional information (in these examples, update the crust type slot value, or change intent from OrderPizza to OrderDrink).    ElicitSlot - Amazon Lex is expecting a slot value for the current intent.  For example, suppose that in the response Amazon Lex sends this message: "What size pizza would you like?". A user might reply with the slot value (e.g., "medium"). The user might also provide additional information in the response (e.g., "medium thick crust pizza"). Amazon Lex can process such additional information appropriately.     Fulfilled - Conveys that the Lambda function configured for the intent has successfully fulfilled the intent.     ReadyForFulfillment - Conveys that the client has to fulfill the intent.     Failed - Conveys that the conversation with the user failed.
