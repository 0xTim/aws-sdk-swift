In addition, the fragments with producer time stamps within the TimestampRange ingested immediately following the first fragment (up to the GetHLSStreamingSessionURLInput$MaxMediaPlaylistFragmentResults value) are included.  Fragments that have duplicate producer time stamps are deduplicated. This means that if producers are producing a stream of fragments with producer time stamps that are approximately equal to the true clock time, the HLS media playlists will contain all of the fragments within the requested time stamp range. If some fragments are ingested within the same time range and very different points in time, only the oldest ingested collection of fragments are returned. When FragmentSelectorType is set to PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP and GetHLSStreamingSessionURLInput$PlaybackMode is LIVE, the producer time stamps are used in the MP4 fragments and for deduplication. But the most recently ingested fragments based on server time stamps are included in the HLS media playlist. This means that even if fragments ingested in the past have producer time stamps with values now, they are not included in the HLS media playlist. The default is SERVER_TIMESTAMP.

        /// Whether to retrieve live or archived, on-demand data. Features of the two types of session include the following:     LIVE : For sessions of this type, the HLS media playlist is continually updated with the latest fragments as they become available. We recommend that the media player retrieve a new playlist on a one-second interval. When this type of session is played in a media player, the user interface typically displays a "live" notification, with no scrubber control for choosing the position in the playback window to display.  In LIVE mode, the newest available fragments are included in an HLS media playlist, even if there is a gap between fragments (that is, if a fragment is missing). A gap like this might cause a media player to halt or cause a jump in playback. In this mode, fragments are not added to the HLS media playlist if they are older than the newest fragment in the playlist. If the missing fragment becomes available after a subsequent fragment is added to the playlist, the older fragment is not added, and the gap is not filled.      ON_DEMAND : For sessions of this type, the HLS media playlist contains all the fragments for the session, up to the number that is specified in MaxMediaPlaylistFragmentResults. The playlist must be retrieved only once for each session. When this type of session is played in a media player, the user interface typically displays a scrubber control for choosing the position in the playback window to display.   In both playback modes, if FragmentSelectorType is PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP, and if there are multiple fragments with the same start time stamp, the fragment that has the larger fragment number (that is, the newer fragment) is included in the HLS media playlist. The other fragments are not included. Fragments that have different time stamps but have overlapping durations are still included in the HLS media playlist. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the media player. The default is LIVE.

The default is ALWAYS when HLSFragmentSelector is SERVER_TIMESTAMP, and NEVER when it is PRODUCER_TIMESTAMP. Media players typically build a timeline of media content to play, based on the time stamps of each fragment. This means that if there is any overlap between fragments (as is typical if HLSFragmentSelector is SERVER_TIMESTAMP), the media player timeline has small gaps between fragments in some places, and overwrites frames in other places. When there are discontinuity flags between fragments, the media player is expected to reset the timeline, resulting in the fragment being played immediately after the previous fragment. We recommend that you always have discontinuity flags between fragments if the fragment time stamps are not accurate or if fragments might be missing. You should not place discontinuity flags between fragments for the player timeline to accurately map to the producer time stamps.

When the PlaybackMode is ON_DEMAND, the oldest fragments are returned, up to this maximum number. When there are a higher number of fragments available in a live HLS media playlist, video players often buffer content before starting playback. Increasing the buffer size increases the playback latency, but it decreases the likelihood that rebuffering will occur during playback. We recommend that a live HLS media playlist have a minimum of 3 fragments and a maximum of 10 fragments. The default is 5 fragments if PlaybackMode is LIVE, and 1,000 if PlaybackMode is ON_DEMAND.  The maximum value of 1,000 fragments corresponds to more than 16 minutes of video on streams with 1-second fragments, and more than 2 1/2 hours of video on streams with 10-second fragments.
