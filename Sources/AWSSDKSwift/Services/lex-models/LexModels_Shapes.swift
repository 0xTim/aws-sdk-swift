When Amazon Lex resolves a slot value, it generates a resolution list that contains up to five possible values for the slot. If you are using a Lambda function, this resolution list is passed to the function. If you are not using a Lambda function you can choose to return the value that the user entered or the first value in the resolution list as the slot value. The valueSelectionStrategy field indicates the option to use.

You may not specify a default value for the childDirected field that does not accurately reflect whether your use of Amazon Lex is related to a website, program, or other application that is directed or targeted, in whole or in part, to children under age 13 and subject to COPPA. If your use of Amazon Lex relates to a website, program, or other application that is directed in whole or in part, to children under age 13, you must obtain any required verifiable parental consent under COPPA.

When you create a clarification prompt, make sure that it suggests the correct response from the user. for example, for a bot that orders pizza and drinks, you might create this clarification prompt: "What would you like to do?

For example, suppose that a user chooses the OrderPizza intent, but gets sidetracked halfway through placing an order. If the user doesn't complete the order within the specified time, Amazon Lex discards the slot information that it gathered, and the user must start over.

If the user's response is not one of the expected responses (for example, "thin crust, "deep dish," etc.), Amazon Lex tries to elicit a correct response a few more times.
