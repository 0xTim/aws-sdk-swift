/**
AWS Direct Connect links your internal network to an AWS Direct Connect location over a standard 1 gigabit or 10 gigabit Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end of the cable is connected to your router, the other to an AWS Direct Connect router. With this connection in place, you can create virtual interfaces directly to the AWS cloud (for example, to Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) and Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)) and to Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC), bypassing Internet service providers in your network path. An AWS Direct Connect location provides access to AWS in the region it is associated with, as well as access to other US regions. For example, you can provision a single connection to any AWS Direct Connect location in the US and use it to access public AWS services in all US Regions and AWS GovCloud (US).

An interconnect is a connection which is capable of hosting other connections. The AWS Direct Connect partner can use an interconnect to provide sub-1Gbps AWS Direct Connect service to tier 2 customers who do not have their own connections. Like a standard connection, an interconnect links the AWS Direct Connect partner's network to an AWS Direct Connect location over a standard 1 Gbps or 10 Gbps Ethernet fiber-optic cable. One end is connected to the partner's router, the other to an AWS Direct Connect router. You can automatically add the new interconnect to a link aggregation group (LAG) by specifying a LAG ID in the request. This ensures that the new interconnect is allocated on the same AWS Direct Connect endpoint that hosts the specified LAG. If there are no available ports on the endpoint, the request fails and no interconnect will be created. For each end customer, the AWS Direct Connect partner provisions a connection on their interconnect by calling AllocateConnectionOnInterconnect.
