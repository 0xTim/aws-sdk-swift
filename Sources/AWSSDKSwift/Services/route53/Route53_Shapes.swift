Using an IP address that is returned by DNS, Amazon Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint. Use one of the following formats for the value of IPAddress:     IPv4 address: four values between 0 and 255, separated by periods (.), for example, 192.0.2.44.    IPv6 address: eight groups of four hexadecimal values, separated by colons (:), for example, 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:abcd:0001:2345. You can also shorten IPv6 addresses as described in RFC 5952, for example, 2001:db8:85a3::abcd:1:2345.   If the endpoint is an EC2 instance, we recommend that you create an Elastic IP address, associate it with your EC2 instance, and specify the Elastic IP address for IPAddress. This ensures that the IP address of your instance never changes. For more information, see Elastic IP Addresses (EIP) in the Amazon EC2 User Guide for Linux Instances.

For more information about IP addresses for which you can't create health checks, see the following documents:    RFC 5735, Special Use IPv4 Addresses     RFC 6598, IANA-Reserved IPv4 Prefix for Shared Address Space     RFC 5156, Special-Use IPv6 Addresses

However, you can't update an existing health check to add or remove the value of IPAddress.    If you specify a value for IPAddress: Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header for all health checks except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks. When Amazon Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the Host header:   If you specify a value of 80 for Port and HTTP or HTTP_STR_MATCH for Type, Amazon Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header.   If you specify a value of 443 for Port and HTTPS or HTTPS_STR_MATCH for Type, Amazon Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header.   If you specify another value for Port and any value except TCP for Type, Amazon Route 53 passes  FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port  to the endpoint in the Host header.   If you don't specify a value for FullyQualifiedDomainName, Amazon Route 53 substitutes the value of IPAddress in the Host header in each of the above cases.  If you don't specify a value for IPAddress: If you don't specify a value for IPAddress, Amazon Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify in FullyQualifiedDomainName at the interval you specify in RequestInterval. Using an IPv4 address that is returned by DNS, Amazon Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.  If you don't specify a value for IPAddress, Amazon Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type of A for the name that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName, the health check fails with a "DNS resolution failed" error.  If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and you choose to specify the endpoint only by FullyQualifiedDomainName, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName, specify the domain name of the server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).  In this configuration, if the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName matches the name of the resource record sets and you then associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be unpredictable.  In addition, if the value of Type is HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP_STR_MATCH, or HTTPS_STR_MATCH, Amazon Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header, as it does when you specify a value for IPAddress. If the value of Type is TCP, Amazon Route 53 doesn't pass a Host header.

A health check can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI is enabled and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration on your endpoint and confirm that your certificate is valid. The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the Common Name field and possibly several more in the Subject Alternative Names field. One of the domain names in the certificate should match the value that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName. If the endpoint responds to the client_hello message with a certificate that does not include the domain name that you specified in FullyQualifiedDomainName, a health checker will retry the handshake. In the second attempt, the health checker will omit FullyQualifiedDomainName from the client_hello message.

AWS Management Console: Go to the EC2 page, choose Load Balancers in the navigation pane, choose the load balancer, choose the Description tab, and get the value of the DNS name field. (If you're routing traffic to a Classic Load Balancer, get the value that begins with dualstack.)     Elastic Load Balancing API: Use DescribeLoadBalancers to get the value of DNSName. For more information, see the applicable guide:   Classic Load Balancer: DescribeLoadBalancers    Application Load Balancer: DescribeLoadBalancers       AWS CLI: Use  describe-load-balancers  to get the value of DNSName.

AWS Management Console: Go to the Amazon EC2 page, click Load Balancers in the navigation pane, select the load balancer, and get the value of the Hosted zone field on the Description tab.    Elastic Load Balancing API: Use DescribeLoadBalancers to get the value of CanonicalHostedZoneNameId. For more information, see the applicable guide:   Classic Load Balancer: DescribeLoadBalancers    Application Load Balancer: DescribeLoadBalancers       AWS CLI: Use  describe-load-balancers  to get the value of CanonicalHostedZoneNameID.    An Amazon S3 bucket configured as a static website  Specify the hosted zone ID for the region that you created the bucket in. For more information about valid values, see the Amazon Simple Storage Service Website Endpoints table in the "AWS Regions and Endpoints" chapter of the Amazon Web Services General Reference.  Another Amazon Route 53 resource record set in your hosted zone  Specify the hosted zone ID of your hosted zone. (An alias resource record set can't reference a resource record set in a different hosted zone.)  
        public var hostedZoneId: String = ""
        ///  Applies only to alias, weighted alias, latency alias, and failover alias record sets: If you set the value of EvaluateTargetHealth to true for the resource record set or sets in an alias, weighted alias, latency alias, or failover alias resource record set, and if you specify a value for  HealthCheck$Id  for every resource record set that is referenced by these alias resource record sets, the alias resource record sets inherit the health of the referenced resource record sets. In this configuration, when Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for an alias resource record set:   Amazon Route 53 looks at the resource record sets that are referenced by the alias resource record sets to determine which health checks they're using.   Amazon Route 53 checks the current status of each health check. (Amazon Route 53 periodically checks the health of the endpoint that is specified in a health check; it doesn't perform the health check when the DNS query arrives.)   Based on the status of the health checks, Amazon Route 53 determines which resource record sets are healthy. Unhealthy resource record sets are immediately removed from consideration. In addition, if all of the resource record sets that are referenced by an alias resource record set are unhealthy, that alias resource record set also is immediately removed from consideration.   Based on the configuration of the alias resource record sets (weighted alias or latency alias, for example) and the configuration of the resource record sets that they reference, Amazon Route 53 chooses a resource record set from the healthy resource record sets, and responds to the query.   Note the following:   You can't set EvaluateTargetHealth to true when the alias target is a CloudFront distribution.   If the AWS resource that you specify in AliasTarget is a resource record set or a group of resource record sets (for example, a group of weighted resource record sets), but it is not another alias resource record set, we recommend that you associate a health check with all of the resource record sets in the alias target.For more information, see What Happens When You Omit Health Checks? in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.   If you specify an Elastic Beanstalk environment in HostedZoneId and DNSName, and if the environment contains an ELB load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy Amazon EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer. (An environment automatically contains an ELB load balancer if it includes more than one EC2 instance.) If you set EvaluateTargetHealth to true and either no EC2 instances are healthy or the load balancer itself is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 routes queries to other available resources that are healthy, if any. If the environment contains a single EC2 instance, there are no special requirements.   If you specify an ELB load balancer in  AliasTarget , Elastic Load Balancing routes queries only to the healthy EC2 instances that are registered with the load balancer. If no EC2 instances are healthy or if the load balancer itself is unhealthy, and if EvaluateTargetHealth is true for the corresponding alias resource record set, Amazon Route 53 routes queries to other resources. When you create a load balancer, you configure settings for Elastic Load Balancing health checks; they're not Amazon Route 53 health checks, but they perform a similar function. Do not create Amazon Route 53 health checks for the EC2 instances that you register with an ELB load balancer. For more information, see How Health Checks Work in More Complex Amazon Route 53 Configurations in the Amazon Route 53 Developers Guide.   We recommend that you set EvaluateTargetHealth to true only when you have enough idle capacity to handle the failure of one or more endpoints.   For more information and examples, see Amazon Route 53 Health Checks and DNS Failover in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.

For example, if you want all queries from Africa to be routed to a web server with an IP address of 192.0.2.111, create a resource record set with a Type of A and a ContinentCode of AF.  Creating geolocation and geolocation alias resource record sets in private hosted zones is not supported.  If you create separate resource record sets for overlapping geographic regions (for example, one resource record set for a continent and one for a country on the same continent), priority goes to the smallest geographic region. This allows you to route most queries for a continent to one resource and to route queries for a country on that continent to a different resource. You can't create two geolocation resource record sets that specify the same geographic location. The value * in the CountryCode element matches all geographic locations that aren't specified in other geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the Name and Type elements.  Geolocation works by mapping IP addresses to locations. However, some IP addresses aren't mapped to geographic locations, so even if you create geolocation resource record sets that cover all seven continents, Amazon Route 53 will receive some DNS queries from locations that it can't identify. We recommend that you create a resource record set for which the value of CountryCode is *, which handles both queries that come from locations for which you haven't created geolocation resource record sets and queries from IP addresses that aren't mapped to a location. If you don't create a * resource record set, Amazon Route 53 returns a "no answer" response for queries from those locations.

For information about how to specify characters other than a-z, 0-9, and - (hyphen) and how to specify internationalized domain names, see DNS Domain Name Format in the Amazon Route 53 Developer Guide.

For example, you can't specify *prod.example.com or prod*.example.com.   The * can't replace any of the middle labels, for example, marketing.*.example.com.   If you include * in any position other than the leftmost label in a domain name, DNS treats it as an * character (ASCII 42), not as a wildcard.  You can't use the * wildcard for resource records sets that have a type of NS.    You can use the * wildcard as the leftmost label in a domain name, for example, *.example.com. You can't use an * for one of the middle labels, for example, marketing.*.example.com. In addition, the * must replace the entire label; for example, you can't specify prod*.example.com.

Amazon Route 53 calculates the sum of the weights for the resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type. Amazon Route 53 then responds to queries based on the ratio of a resource's weight to the total. Note the following:   You must specify a value for the Weight element for every weighted resource record set.   You can only specify one ResourceRecord per weighted resource record set.   You can't create latency, failover, or geolocation resource record sets that have the same values for the Name and Type elements as weighted resource record sets.   You can create a maximum of 100 weighted resource record sets that have the same values for the Name and Type elements.   For weighted (but not weighted alias) resource record sets, if you set Weight to 0 for a resource record set, Amazon Route 53 never responds to queries with the applicable value for that resource record set. However, if you set Weight to 0 for all resource record sets that have the same combination of DNS name and type, traffic is routed to all resources with equal probability. The effect of setting Weight to 0 is different when you associate health checks with weighted resource record sets.

Creating latency and latency alias resource record sets in private hosted zones is not supported.  When Amazon Route 53 receives a DNS query for a domain name and type for which you have created latency resource record sets, Amazon Route 53 selects the latency resource record set that has the lowest latency between the end user and the associated Amazon EC2 Region. Amazon Route 53 then returns the value that is associated with the selected resource record set. Note the following:   You can only specify one ResourceRecord per latency resource record set.   You can only create one latency resource record set for each Amazon EC2 Region.   You aren't required to create latency resource record sets for all Amazon EC2 Regions. Amazon Route 53 will choose the region with the best latency from among the regions for which you create latency resource record sets.

Except where noted, the following failover behaviors assume that you have included the HealthCheckId element in both resource record sets:   When the primary resource record set is healthy, Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the primary resource record set regardless of the health of the secondary resource record set.   When the primary resource record set is unhealthy and the secondary resource record set is healthy, Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the secondary resource record set.   When the secondary resource record set is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the primary resource record set regardless of the health of the primary resource record set.   If you omit the HealthCheckId element for the secondary resource record set, and if the primary resource record set is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 always responds to DNS queries with the applicable value from the secondary resource record set. This is true regardless of the health of the associated endpoint.   You can't create non-failover resource record sets that have the same values for the Name and Type elements as failover resource record sets. For failover alias resource record sets, you must also include the EvaluateTargetHealth element and set the value to true.

Amazon Route 53 determines whether a resource record set is healthy based on one of the following:   By periodically sending a request to the endpoint that is specified in the health check   By aggregating the status of a specified group of health checks (calculated health checks)   By determining the current state of a CloudWatch alarm (CloudWatch metric health checks)   For more information, see How Amazon Route 53 Determines Whether an Endpoint Is Healthy. The HealthCheckId element is only useful when Amazon Route 53 is choosing between two or more resource record sets to respond to a DNS query, and you want Amazon Route 53 to base the choice in part on the status of a health check. Configuring health checks only makes sense in the following configurations:   You're checking the health of the resource record sets in a group of weighted, latency, geolocation, or failover resource record sets, and you specify health check IDs for all of the resource record sets. If the health check for one resource record set specifies an endpoint that is not healthy, Amazon Route 53 stops responding to queries using the value for that resource record set.   You set EvaluateTargetHealth to true for the resource record sets in a group of alias, weighted alias, latency alias, geolocation alias, or failover alias resource record sets, and you specify health check IDs for all of the resource record sets that are referenced by the alias resource record sets.    Amazon Route 53 doesn't check the health of the endpoint specified in the resource record set, for example, the endpoint specified by the IP address in the Value element. When you add a HealthCheckId element to a resource record set, Amazon Route 53 checks the health of the endpoint that you specified in the health check.   For geolocation resource record sets, if an endpoint is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 looks for a resource record set for the larger, associated geographic region. For example, suppose you have resource record sets for a state in the United States, for the United States, for North America, and for all locations. If the endpoint for the state resource record set is unhealthy, Amazon Route 53 checks the resource record sets for the United States, for North America, and for all locations (a resource record set for which the value of CountryCode is *), in that order, until it finds a resource record set for which the endpoint is healthy.  If your health checks specify the endpoint only by domain name, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName, specify the domain name of the server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (example.com).  n this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName matches the name of the resource record sets and then associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be unpredictable.

If you specify a value for IPAddress: Amazon Route 53 sends health check requests to the specified IPv4 or IPv6 address and passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header for all health checks except TCP health checks. This is typically the fully qualified DNS name of the endpoint on which you want Amazon Route 53 to perform health checks. When Amazon Route 53 checks the health of an endpoint, here is how it constructs the Host header:   If you specify a value of 80 for Port and HTTP or HTTP_STR_MATCH for Type, Amazon Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header.    If you specify a value of 443 for Port and HTTPS or HTTPS_STR_MATCH for Type, Amazon Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the Host header.   If you specify another value for Port and any value except TCP for Type, Amazon Route 53 passes FullyQualifiedDomainName:Port to the endpoint in the Host header.   If you don't specify a value for FullyQualifiedDomainName, Amazon Route 53 substitutes the value of IPAddress in the Host header in each of the preceding cases.  If you don't specify a value for IPAddress : Amazon Route 53 sends a DNS request to the domain that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName at the interval that you specify for RequestInterval. Using an IPv4 address that DNS returns, Amazon Route 53 then checks the health of the endpoint.  If you don't specify a value for IPAddress, Amazon Route 53 uses only IPv4 to send health checks to the endpoint. If there's no resource record set with a type of A for the name that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName, the health check fails with a "DNS resolution failed" error.  If you want to check the health of weighted, latency, or failover resource record sets and you choose to specify the endpoint only by FullyQualifiedDomainName, we recommend that you create a separate health check for each endpoint. For example, create a health check for each HTTP server that is serving content for www.example.com. For the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName, specify the domain name of the server (such as us-east-2-www.example.com), not the name of the resource record sets (www.example.com).  In this configuration, if you create a health check for which the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName matches the name of the resource record sets and you then associate the health check with those resource record sets, health check results will be unpredictable.  In addition, if the value that you specify for Type is HTTP, HTTPS, HTTP_STR_MATCH, or HTTPS_STR_MATCH, Amazon Route 53 passes the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName in the Host header, as it does when you specify a value for IPAddress. If the value of Type is TCP, Amazon Route 53 doesn't pass a Host header.
        public var fullyQualifiedDomainName: String? = nil
        /// The number of seconds between the time that Amazon Route 53 gets a response from your endpoint and the time that it sends the next health check request. Each Amazon Route 53 health checker makes requests at this interval.  You can't change the value of RequestInterval after you create a health check.  If you don't specify a value for RequestInterval, the default value is 30 seconds.
        public var requestInterval: Int32? = nil
        /// The type of health check that you want to create, which indicates how Amazon Route 53 determines whether an endpoint is healthy.  You can't change the value of Type after you create a health check.  You can create the following types of health checks:    HTTP: Amazon Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Amazon Route 53 submits an HTTP request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.    HTTPS: Amazon Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Amazon Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and waits for an HTTP status code of 200 or greater and less than 400.  If you specify HTTPS for the value of Type, the endpoint must support TLS v1.0 or later.     HTTP_STR_MATCH: Amazon Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Amazon Route 53 submits an HTTP request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the string that you specify in SearchString.    HTTPS_STR_MATCH: Amazon Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection. If successful, Amazon Route 53 submits an HTTPS request and searches the first 5,120 bytes of the response body for the string that you specify in SearchString.    TCP: Amazon Route 53 tries to establish a TCP connection.    CLOUDWATCH_METRIC: The health check is associated with a CloudWatch alarm. If the state of the alarm is OK, the health check is considered healthy. If the state is ALARM, the health check is considered unhealthy. If CloudWatch doesn't have sufficient data to determine whether the state is OK or ALARM, the health check status depends on the setting for InsufficientDataHealthStatus: Healthy, Unhealthy, or LastKnownStatus.     CALCULATED: For health checks that monitor the status of other health checks, Amazon Route 53 adds up the number of health checks that Amazon Route 53 health checkers consider to be healthy and compares that number with the value of HealthThreshold.    For more information about how Amazon Route 53 determines whether an endpoint is healthy, see the introduction to this topic.

        /// Specify whether you want Amazon Route 53 to send the value of FullyQualifiedDomainName to the endpoint in the client_hello message during TLS negotiation. This allows the endpoint to respond to HTTPS health check requests with the applicable SSL/TLS certificate. Some endpoints require that HTTPS requests include the host name in the client_hello message. If you don't enable SNI, the status of the health check will be SSL alert handshake_failure. A health check can also have that status for other reasons. If SNI is enabled and you're still getting the error, check the SSL/TLS configuration on your endpoint and confirm that your certificate is valid. The SSL/TLS certificate on your endpoint includes a domain name in the Common Name field and possibly several more in the Subject Alternative Names field. One of the domain names in the certificate should match the value that you specify for FullyQualifiedDomainName. If the endpoint responds to the client_hello message with a certificate that does not include the domain name that you specified in FullyQualifiedDomainName, a health checker will retry the handshake. In the second attempt, the health checker will omit FullyQualifiedDomainName from the client_hello message.
