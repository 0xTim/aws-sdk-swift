If your results were truncated, you can make a subsequent pagination request using the Marker request parameter to retrieve more items. Note that IAM might return fewer than the MaxItems number of results even when there are more results available. We recommend that you check IsTruncated after every call to ensure that you receive all of your results.
        public let isTruncated: Bool?
        /// A list of roles.
        public let roles: [Role]
        /// When IsTruncated is true, this element is present and contains the value to use for the Marker parameter in a subsequent pagination request.
        public let marker: String?

        public init(isTruncated: Bool? = nil, roles: [Role], marker: String? = nil) {
            self.isTruncated = isTruncated
            self.roles = roles
            self.marker = marker
        }

        private enum CodingKeys: String, CodingKey {
            case isTruncated = "IsTruncated"
            case roles = "Roles"
            case marker = "Marker"
        }
    }
