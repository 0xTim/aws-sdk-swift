Amazon Route 53 assigns four name servers to your hosted zone and automatically updates your domain registration with the names of these name servers. Enables autorenew, so your domain registration will renew automatically each year. We'll notify you in advance of the renewal date so you can choose whether to renew the registration. Optionally enables privacy protection, so WHOIS queries return contact information for our registrar partner, Gandi, instead of the information you entered for registrant, admin, and tech contacts. If registration is successful, returns an operation ID that you can use to track the progress and completion of the action. If the request is not completed successfully, the domain registrant is notified by email. Charges your AWS account an amount based on the top-level domain.

If the registrar for your domain is also the DNS service provider for the domain, we highly recommend that you consider transferring your DNS service to Amazon Route 53 or to another DNS service provider before you transfer your registration. Some registrars provide free DNS service when you purchase a domain registration. When you transfer the registration, the previous registrar will not renew your domain registration and could end your DNS service at any time. Caution! If the registrar for your domain is also the DNS service provider for the domain and you don't transfer DNS service to another provider, your website, email, and the web applications associated with the domain might become unavailable. If the transfer is successful, this method returns an operation ID that you can use to track the progress and completion of the action. If the transfer doesn't complete successfully, the domain registrant will be notified by email.
