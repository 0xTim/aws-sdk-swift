/**
AWS Cloud9 AWS Cloud9 is a collection of tools that you can use to code, build, run, test, debug, and release software in the cloud. In the background, these tools are available through development environments running on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances (known as Amazon EC2 environments), your own servers (known as SSH environments), or a combination. This enables you to create and switch between multiple environments, with each environment set up for a specific development project. For more information about AWS Cloud9, see the AWS Cloud9 User Guide. AWS Cloud9 supports these operations:    CreateEnvironmentEC2: Creates an AWS Cloud9 development environment, launches an Amazon EC2 instance, and then hosts the environment on the instance.    CreateEnvironmentMembership: Adds an environment member to an environment.    DeleteEnvironment: Deletes an environment. If the environment is hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance, also terminates the instance.    DeleteEnvironmentMembership: Deletes an environment member from an environment.    DescribeEnvironmentMemberships: Gets information about environment members for an environment.    DescribeEnvironments: Gets information about environments.    DescribeEnvironmentStatus: Gets status information for an environment.    ListEnvironments: Gets a list of environment identifiers.    UpdateEnvironment: Changes the settings of an existing environment.    UpdateEnvironmentMembership: Changes the settings of an existing environment member for an environment.
