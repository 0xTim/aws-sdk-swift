/**
AWS Config AWS Config provides a way to keep track of the configurations of all the AWS resources associated with your AWS account. You can use AWS Config to get the current and historical configurations of each AWS resource and also to get information about the relationship between the resources. An AWS resource can be an Amazon Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance, an Elastic Block Store (EBS) volume, an Elastic network Interface (ENI), or a security group. For a complete list of resources currently supported by AWS Config, see Supported AWS Resources. You can access and manage AWS Config through the AWS Management Console, the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), the AWS Config API, or the AWS SDKs for AWS Config This reference guide contains documentation for the AWS Config API and the AWS CLI commands that you can use to manage AWS Config. The AWS Config API uses the Signature Version 4 protocol for signing requests. For more information about how to sign a request with this protocol, see Signature Version 4 Signing Process. For detailed information about AWS Config features and their associated actions or commands, as well as how to work with AWS Management Console, see What Is AWS Config? in the AWS Config Developer Guide.

If you are adding a new AWS managed Config rule, specify the rule's identifier for the SourceIdentifier key. To reference AWS managed Config rule identifiers, see Using AWS Managed Config Rules. For any new rule that you add, specify the ConfigRuleName in the ConfigRule object. Do not specify the ConfigRuleArn or the ConfigRuleId. These values are generated by AWS Config for new rules. If you are updating a rule that you added previously, you can specify the rule by ConfigRuleName, ConfigRuleId, or ConfigRuleArn in the ConfigRule data type that you use in this request.
