        ///  A list of input parameters whose values you want to update for the specified stack instances.  Any overridden parameter values will be applied to all stack instances in the specified accounts and regions. When specifying parameters and their values, be aware of how AWS CloudFormation sets parameter values during stack instance update operations:   To override the current value for a parameter, include the parameter and specify its value.   To leave a parameter set to its present value, you can do one of the following:   Do not include the parameter in the list.   Include the parameter and specify UsePreviousValue as true. (You cannot specify both a value and set UsePreviousValue to true.)     To set all overridden parameter back to the values specified in the stack set, specify a parameter list but do not include any parameters.   To leave all parameters set to their present values, do not specify this property at all.   During stack set updates, any parameter values overridden for a stack instance are not updated, but retain their overridden value. You can only override the parameter values that are specified in the stack set; to add or delete a parameter itself, use UpdateStackSet to update the stack set template. If you add a parameter to a template, before you can override the parameter value specified in the stack set you must first use UpdateStackSet to update all stack instances with the updated template and parameter value specified in the stack set. Once a stack instance has been updated with the new parameter, you can then override the parameter value using UpdateStackInstances.

For example, if your template includes a reference to a resource that is conditionally recreated, the value of the reference (the physical ID of the resource) might change, depending on if the resource is recreated.

For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.   If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.    If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.    If you don't specify either of these capabilities, AWS CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.   If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.

CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually creating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to create a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation. Change sets do not currently support nested stacks. If you want to create a stack from a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks, you must create the stack directly from the template using this capability.  You should only create stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs. Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the function operation without AWS CloudFormation being notified.  For more information, see Using AWS CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates.

CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM  Some stack templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your AWS account; for example, by creating new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stacks, you must explicitly acknowledge this by specifying one of these capabilities. The following IAM resources require you to specify either the CAPABILITY_IAM or CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM capability.   If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability.    If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM.    If you don't specify either of these capabilities, AWS CloudFormation returns an InsufficientCapabilities error.   If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary.

CAPABILITY_AUTO_EXPAND  Some template contain macros. Macros perform custom processing on templates; this can include simple actions like find-and-replace operations, all the way to extensive transformations of entire templates. Because of this, users typically create a change set from the processed template, so that they can review the changes resulting from the macros before actually updating the stack. If your stack template contains one or more macros, and you choose to update a stack directly from the processed template, without first reviewing the resulting changes in a change set, you must acknowledge this capability. This includes the AWS::Include and AWS::Serverless transforms, which are macros hosted by AWS CloudFormation. Change sets do not currently support nested stacks. If you want to update a stack from a stack template that contains macros and nested stacks, you must update the stack directly from the template using this capability.  You should only update stacks directly from a stack template that contains macros if you know what processing the macro performs. Each macro relies on an underlying Lambda service function for processing stack templates. Be aware that the Lambda function owner can update the function operation without AWS CloudFormation being notified.  For more information, see Using AWS CloudFormation Macros to Perform Custom Processing on Templates.

Some stack set templates might include resources that can affect permissions in your AWS account—for example, by creating new AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) users. For those stack sets, you must explicitly acknowledge their capabilities by specifying this parameter. The only valid values are CAPABILITY_IAM and CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM. The following resources require you to specify this parameter:    AWS::IAM::AccessKey   AWS::IAM::Group   AWS::IAM::InstanceProfile   AWS::IAM::Policy   AWS::IAM::Role   AWS::IAM::User   AWS::IAM::UserToGroupAddition   If your stack template contains these resources, we recommend that you review all permissions that are associated with them and edit their permissions if necessary. If you have IAM resources, you can specify either capability. If you have IAM resources with custom names, you must specify CAPABILITY_NAMED_IAM. If you don't specify this parameter, this action returns an InsufficientCapabilities error. For more information, see Acknowledging IAM Resources in AWS CloudFormation Templates.

This means:   If you don't specify this parameter, AWS CloudFormation doesn't modify the stack's tags.    If you specify any tags using this parameter, you must specify all the tags that you want associated with this stack set, even tags you've specifed before (for example, when creating the stack set or during a previous update of the stack set.). Any tags that you don't include in the updated list of tags are removed from the stack set, and therefore from the stacks and resources as well.    If you specify an empty value, AWS CloudFormation removes all currently associated tags.   If you specify new tags as part of an UpdateStackSet action, AWS CloudFormation checks to see if you have the required IAM permission to tag resources. If you omit tags that are currently associated with the stack set from the list of tags you specify, AWS CloudFormation assumes that you want to remove those tags from the stack set, and checks to see if you have permission to untag resources. If you don't have the necessary permission(s), the entire UpdateStackSet action fails with an access denied error, and the stack set is not updated.

Specify this property to skip rolling back resources that AWS CloudFormation can't successfully roll back. We recommend that you  troubleshoot resources before skipping them.
