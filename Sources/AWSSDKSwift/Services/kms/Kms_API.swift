/**
AWS Key Management Service AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) is an encryption and key management web service. This guide describes the AWS KMS operations that you can call programmatically. For general information about AWS KMS, see the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.  AWS provides SDKs that consist of libraries and sample code for various programming languages and platforms (Java, Ruby, .Net, iOS, Android, etc.). The SDKs provide a convenient way to create programmatic access to AWS KMS and other AWS services. For example, the SDKs take care of tasks such as signing requests (see below), managing errors, and retrying requests automatically. For more information about the AWS SDKs, including how to download and install them, see Tools for Amazon Web Services.  We recommend that you use the AWS SDKs to make programmatic API calls to AWS KMS. Clients must support TLS (Transport Layer Security) 1.0. We recommend TLS 1.2. Clients must also support cipher suites with Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS) such as Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) or Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (ECDHE). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.  Signing Requests  Requests must be signed by using an access key ID and a secret access key. We strongly recommend that you do not use your AWS account (root) access key ID and secret key for everyday work with AWS KMS. Instead, use the access key ID and secret access key for an IAM user, or you can use the AWS Security Token Service to generate temporary security credentials that you can use to sign requests. All AWS KMS operations require Signature Version 4.  Logging API Requests  AWS KMS supports AWS CloudTrail, a service that logs AWS API calls and related events for your AWS account and delivers them to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. By using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine what requests were made to AWS KMS, who made the request, when it was made, and so on. To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to turn it on and find your log files, see the AWS CloudTrail User Guide.  Additional Resources  For more information about credentials and request signing, see the following:    AWS Security Credentials - This topic provides general information about the types of credentials used for accessing AWS.    Temporary Security Credentials - This section of the IAM User Guide describes how to create and use temporary security credentials.    Signature Version 4 Signing Process - This set of topics walks you through the process of signing a request using an access key ID and a secret access key.    Commonly Used APIs  Of the APIs discussed in this guide, the following will prove the most useful for most applications. You will likely perform actions other than these, such as creating keys and assigning policies, by using the console.    Encrypt     Decrypt     GenerateDataKey     GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext

You must also specify the length of the data key using either the KeySpec or NumberOfBytes field. You must specify one field or the other, but not both. For common key lengths (128-bit and 256-bit symmetric keys), we recommend that you use KeySpec. To perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter. This operation returns a plaintext copy of the data key in the Plaintext field of the response, and an encrypted copy of the data key in the CiphertextBlob field. The data key is encrypted under the CMK specified in the KeyId field of the request.  We recommend that you use the following pattern to encrypt data locally in your application:   Use this operation (GenerateDataKey) to get a data encryption key.   Use the plaintext data encryption key (returned in the Plaintext field of the response) to encrypt data locally, then erase the plaintext data key from memory.   Store the encrypted data key (returned in the CiphertextBlob field of the response) alongside the locally encrypted data.   To decrypt data locally:   Use the Decrypt operation to decrypt the encrypted data key into a plaintext copy of the data key.   Use the plaintext data key to decrypt data locally, then erase the plaintext data key from memory.   To return only an encrypted copy of the data key, use GenerateDataKeyWithoutPlaintext. To return a random byte string that is cryptographically secure, use GenerateRandom. If you use the optional EncryptionContext field, you must store at least enough information to be able to reconstruct the full encryption context when you later send the ciphertext to the Decrypt operation. It is a good practice to choose an encryption context that you can reconstruct on the fly to better secure the ciphertext. For more information, see Encryption Context in the AWS Key Management Service Developer Guide.

To move encrypted data from one AWS region to another, you can use this operation to encrypt in the new region the plaintext data key that was used to encrypt the data in the original region. This provides you with an encrypted copy of the data key that can be decrypted in the new region and used there to decrypt the encrypted data.   To perform this operation on a CMK in a different AWS account, specify the key ARN or alias ARN in the value of the KeyId parameter. Unless you are moving encrypted data from one region to another, you don't use this operation to encrypt a generated data key within a region.
