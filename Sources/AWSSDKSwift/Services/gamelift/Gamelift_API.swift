/**
Amazon GameLift Service  Amazon GameLift is a managed service for developers who need a scalable, dedicated server solution for their multiplayer games. Amazon GameLift provides tools for the following tasks: (1) acquire computing resources and deploy game servers, (2) scale game server capacity to meet player demand, (3) host game sessions and manage player access, and (4) track in-depth metrics on player usage and server performance. The Amazon GameLift service API includes two important function sets:    Manage game sessions and player access -- Retrieve information on available game sessions; create new game sessions; send player requests to join a game session.    Configure and manage game server resources -- Manage builds, fleets, queues, and aliases; set autoscaling policies; retrieve logs and metrics.   This reference guide describes the low-level service API for Amazon GameLift. You can use the API functionality with these tools:    The Amazon Web Services software development kit (AWS SDK) is available in multiple languages including C++ and C#. Use the SDK to access the API programmatically from an application, such as a game client.   The AWS command-line interface (CLI) tool is primarily useful for handling administrative actions, such as setting up and managing Amazon GameLift settings and resources. You can use the AWS CLI to manage all of your AWS services.   The AWS Management Console for Amazon GameLift provides a web interface to manage your Amazon GameLift settings and resources. The console includes a dashboard for tracking key resources, including builds and fleets, and displays usage and performance metrics for your games as customizable graphs.   Amazon GameLift Local is a tool for testing your game's integration with Amazon GameLift before deploying it on the service. This tools supports a subset of key API actions, which can be called from either the AWS CLI or programmatically. See Testing an Integration.

    ///  Creates a new fleet to run your game servers. A fleet is a set of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, each of which can run multiple server processes to host game sessions. You configure a fleet to create instances with certain hardware specifications (see Amazon EC2 Instance Types for more information), and deploy a specified game build to each instance. A newly created fleet passes through several statuses; once it reaches the ACTIVE status, it can begin hosting game sessions. To create a new fleet, you must specify the following: (1) fleet name, (2) build ID of an uploaded game build, (3) an EC2 instance type, and (4) a run-time configuration that describes which server processes to run on each instance in the fleet. (Although the run-time configuration is not a required parameter, the fleet cannot be successfully activated without it.) You can also configure the new fleet with the following settings:   Fleet description   Access permissions for inbound traffic   Fleet-wide game session protection   Resource creation limit   If you use Amazon CloudWatch for metrics, you can add the new fleet to a metric group. This allows you to view aggregated metrics for a set of fleets. Once you specify a metric group, the new fleet's metrics are included in the metric group's data. You have the option of creating a VPC peering connection with the new fleet. For more information, see VPC Peering with Amazon GameLift Fleets. If the CreateFleet call is successful, Amazon GameLift performs the following tasks:   Creates a fleet record and sets the status to NEW (followed by other statuses as the fleet is activated).   Sets the fleet's target capacity to 1 (desired instances), which causes Amazon GameLift to start one new EC2 instance.   Starts launching server processes on the instance. If the fleet is configured to run multiple server processes per instance, Amazon GameLift staggers each launch by a few seconds.   Begins writing events to the fleet event log, which can be accessed in the Amazon GameLift console.   Sets the fleet's status to ACTIVE as soon as one server process in the fleet is ready to host a game session.

An active scaling policy prompts Amazon GameLift to track a certain metric for a fleet and automatically change the fleet's capacity in specific circumstances. Each scaling policy contains one rule statement. Fleets can have multiple scaling policies in force simultaneously. A scaling policy rule statement has the following structure: If [MetricName] is [ComparisonOperator] [Threshold] for [EvaluationPeriods] minutes, then [ScalingAdjustmentType] to/by [ScalingAdjustment]. For example, this policy: "If the number of idle instances exceeds 20 for more than 15 minutes, then reduce the fleet capacity by 10 instances" could be implemented as the following rule statement: If [IdleInstances] is [GreaterThanOrEqualToThreshold] [20] for [15] minutes, then [ChangeInCapacity] by [-10].

    ///  Places a request for a new game session in a queue (see CreateGameSessionQueue). When processing a placement request, Amazon GameLift searches for available resources on the queue's destinations, scanning each until it finds resources or the placement request times out. A game session placement request can also request player sessions. When a new game session is successfully created, Amazon GameLift creates a player session for each player included in the request. When placing a game session, by default Amazon GameLift tries each fleet in the order they are listed in the queue configuration. Ideally, a queue's destinations are listed in preference order. Alternatively, when requesting a game session with players, you can also provide latency data for each player in relevant regions. Latency data indicates the performance lag a player experiences when connected to a fleet in the region. Amazon GameLift uses latency data to reorder the list of destinations to place the game session in a region with minimal lag. If latency data is provided for multiple players, Amazon GameLift calculates each region's average lag for all players and reorders to get the best game play across all players.  To place a new game session request, specify the following:   The queue name and a set of game session properties and settings   A unique ID (such as a UUID) for the placement. You use this ID to track the status of the placement request   (Optional) A set of IDs and player data for each player you want to join to the new game session   Latency data for all players (if you want to optimize game play for the players)   If successful, a new game session placement is created. To track the status of a placement request, call DescribeGameSessionPlacement and check the request's status.

    ///  Uses FlexMatch to create a game match for a group of players based on custom matchmaking rules, and starts a new game for the matched players. Each matchmaking request specifies the type of match to build (team configuration, rules for an acceptable match, etc.). The request also specifies the players to find a match for and where to host the new game session for optimal performance. A matchmaking request might start with a single player or a group of players who want to play together. FlexMatch finds additional players as needed to fill the match. Match type, rules, and the queue used to place a new game session are defined in a MatchmakingConfiguration. For complete information on setting up and using FlexMatch, see the topic  Adding FlexMatch to Your Game. To start matchmaking, provide a unique ticket ID, specify a matchmaking configuration, and include the players to be matched. You must also include a set of player attributes relevant for the matchmaking configuration. If successful, a matchmaking ticket is returned with status set to QUEUED. Track the status of the ticket to respond as needed and acquire game session connection information for successfully completed matches.  Tracking ticket status -- A couple of options are available for tracking the status of matchmaking requests:    Polling -- Call DescribeMatchmaking. This operation returns the full ticket object, including current status and (for completed tickets) game session connection info. We recommend polling no more than once every 10 seconds.   Notifications -- Get event notifications for changes in ticket status using Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS). Notifications are easy to set up (see CreateMatchmakingConfiguration) and typically deliver match status changes faster and more efficiently than polling. We recommend that you use polling to back up to notifications (since delivery is not guaranteed) and call DescribeMatchmaking only when notifications are not received within 30 seconds.    Processing a matchmaking request -- FlexMatch handles a matchmaking request as follows:    Your client code submits a StartMatchmaking request for one or more players and tracks the status of the request ticket.    FlexMatch uses this ticket and others in process to build an acceptable match. When a potential match is identified, all tickets in the proposed match are advanced to the next status.    If the match requires player acceptance (set in the matchmaking configuration), the tickets move into status REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE. This status triggers your client code to solicit acceptance from all players in every ticket involved in the match, and then call AcceptMatch for each player. If any player rejects or fails to accept the match before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped (see AcceptMatch for more details).   Once a match is proposed and accepted, the matchmaking tickets move into status PLACING. FlexMatch locates resources for a new game session using the game session queue (set in the matchmaking configuration) and creates the game session based on the match data.    When the match is successfully placed, the matchmaking tickets move into COMPLETED status. Connection information (including game session endpoint and player session) is added to the matchmaking tickets. Matched players can use the connection information to join the game.

    ///  Registers a player's acceptance or rejection of a proposed FlexMatch match. A matchmaking configuration may require player acceptance; if so, then matches built with that configuration cannot be completed unless all players accept the proposed match within a specified time limit.  When FlexMatch builds a match, all the matchmaking tickets involved in the proposed match are placed into status REQUIRES_ACCEPTANCE. This is a trigger for your game to get acceptance from all players in the ticket. Acceptances are only valid for tickets when they are in this status; all other acceptances result in an error. To register acceptance, specify the ticket ID, a response, and one or more players. Once all players have registered acceptance, the matchmaking tickets advance to status PLACING, where a new game session is created for the match.  If any player rejects the match, or if acceptances are not received before a specified timeout, the proposed match is dropped. The matchmaking tickets are then handled in one of two ways: For tickets where all players accepted the match, the ticket status is returned to SEARCHING to find a new match. For tickets where one or more players failed to accept the match, the ticket status is set to FAILED, and processing is terminated. A new matchmaking request for these players can be submitted as needed.  Matchmaking-related operations include:    StartMatchmaking     DescribeMatchmaking     StopMatchmaking     AcceptMatch

To create a matchmaking configuration, at a minimum you must specify the following: configuration name; a rule set that governs how to evaluate players and find acceptable matches; a game session queue to use when placing a new game session for the match; and the maximum time allowed for a matchmaking attempt.  Player acceptance -- In each configuration, you have the option to require that all players accept participation in a proposed match. To enable this feature, set AcceptanceRequired to true and specify a time limit for player acceptance. Players have the option to accept or reject a proposed match, and a match does not move ahead to game session placement unless all matched players accept.   Matchmaking status notification -- There are two ways to track the progress of matchmaking tickets: (1) polling ticket status with DescribeMatchmaking; or (2) receiving notifications with Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS). To use notifications, you first need to set up an SNS topic to receive the notifications, and provide the topic ARN in the matchmaking configuration (see  Setting up Notifications for Matchmaking).

    ///  Creates an alias for a fleet. In most situations, you can use an alias ID in place of a fleet ID. By using a fleet alias instead of a specific fleet ID, you can switch gameplay and players to a new fleet without changing your game client or other game components. For example, for games in production, using an alias allows you to seamlessly redirect your player base to a new game server update.  Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. A simple alias points to an active fleet. A terminal alias is used to display messaging or link to a URL instead of routing players to an active fleet. For example, you might use a terminal alias when a game version is no longer supported and you want to direct players to an upgrade site.  To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description. Each simple alias can point to only one fleet, but a fleet can have multiple aliases. If successful, a new alias record is returned, including an alias ID, which you can reference when creating a game session. You can reassign an alias to another fleet by calling UpdateAlias.

You can set up a queue to try to place game sessions on fleets in multiple regions. To add placement requests to a queue, call StartGameSessionPlacement and reference the queue name.  Destination order. When processing a request for a game session, Amazon GameLift tries each destination in order until it finds one with available resources to host the new game session. A queue's default order is determined by how destinations are listed. The default order is overridden when a game session placement request provides player latency information. Player latency information enables Amazon GameLift to prioritize destinations where players report the lowest average latency, as a result placing the new game session where the majority of players will have the best possible gameplay experience.  Player latency policies. For placement requests containing player latency information, use player latency policies to protect individual players from very high latencies. With a latency cap, even when a destination can deliver a low latency for most players, the game is not placed where any individual player is reporting latency higher than a policy's maximum. A queue can have multiple latency policies, which are enforced consecutively starting with the policy with the lowest latency cap. Use multiple policies to gradually relax latency controls; for example, you might set a policy with a low latency cap for the first 60 seconds, a second policy with a higher cap for the next 60 seconds, etc.  To create a new queue, provide a name, timeout value, a list of destinations and, if desired, a set of latency policies.
