If you specify a resolution that is less than the resolution of the input file, Elastic Transcoder rescales the output file to the lower resolution.   If you specify a resolution that is greater than the resolution of the input file, Elastic Transcoder rescales the output to the higher resolution.   We recommend that you specify a resolution for which the product of width and height is less than or equal to the applicable value in the following list (List - Max width x height value):   1 - 25344   1b - 25344   1.1 - 101376   1.2 - 101376   1.3 - 101376   2 - 101376   2.1 - 202752   2.2 - 404720   3 - 404720   3.1 - 921600   3.2 - 1310720   4 - 2097152   4.1 - 2097152

Specify the maximum frame rate that you want Elastic Transcoder to use when the frame rate of the input video is greater than the desired maximum frame rate of the output video. Valid values include: 10, 15, 23.97, 24, 25, 29.97, 30, 60.
        public var maxFrameRate: String? = nil
        ///  Profile (H.264/VP8/VP9 Only)  The H.264 profile that you want to use for the output file. Elastic Transcoder supports the following profiles:    baseline: The profile most commonly used for videoconferencing and for mobile applications.    main: The profile used for standard-definition digital TV broadcasts.    high: The profile used for high-definition digital TV broadcasts and for Blu-ray discs.    Level (H.264 Only)  The H.264 level that you want to use for the output file. Elastic Transcoder supports the following levels:  1, 1b, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2, 2.1, 2.2, 3, 3.1, 3.2, 4, 4.1   MaxReferenceFrames (H.264 Only)  Applicable only when the value of Video:Codec is H.264. The maximum number of previously decoded frames to use as a reference for decoding future frames. Valid values are integers 0 through 16, but we recommend that you not use a value greater than the following:  Min(Floor(Maximum decoded picture buffer in macroblocks * 256 / (Width in pixels * Height in pixels)), 16)  where Width in pixels and Height in pixels represent either MaxWidth and MaxHeight, or Resolution. Maximum decoded picture buffer in macroblocks depends on the value of the Level object. See the list below. (A macroblock is a block of pixels measuring 16x16.)    1 - 396   1b - 396   1.1 - 900   1.2 - 2376   1.3 - 2376   2 - 2376   2.1 - 4752   2.2 - 8100   3 - 8100   3.1 - 18000   3.2 - 20480   4 - 32768   4.1 - 32768    MaxBitRate (Optional, H.264/MPEG2/VP8/VP9 only)  The maximum number of bits per second in a video buffer; the size of the buffer is specified by BufferSize. Specify a value between 16 and 62,500. You can reduce the bandwidth required to stream a video by reducing the maximum bit rate, but this also reduces the quality of the video.  BufferSize (Optional, H.264/MPEG2/VP8/VP9 only)  The maximum number of bits in any x seconds of the output video. This window is commonly 10 seconds, the standard segment duration when you're using FMP4 or MPEG-TS for the container type of the output video. Specify an integer greater than 0. If you specify MaxBitRate and omit BufferSize, Elastic Transcoder sets BufferSize to 10 times the value of MaxBitRate.  InterlacedMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only)  The interlace mode for the output video. Interlaced video is used to double the perceived frame rate for a video by interlacing two fields (one field on every other line, the other field on the other lines) so that the human eye registers multiple pictures per frame. Interlacing reduces the bandwidth required for transmitting a video, but can result in blurred images and flickering. Valid values include Progressive (no interlacing, top to bottom), TopFirst (top field first), BottomFirst (bottom field first), and Auto. If InterlaceMode is not specified, Elastic Transcoder uses Progressive for the output. If Auto is specified, Elastic Transcoder interlaces the output.  ColorSpaceConversionMode (Optional, H.264/MPEG2 Only)  The color space conversion Elastic Transcoder applies to the output video. Color spaces are the algorithms used by the computer to store information about how to render color. Bt.601 is the standard for standard definition video, while Bt.709 is the standard for high definition video. Valid values include None, Bt709toBt601, Bt601toBt709, and Auto. If you chose Auto for ColorSpaceConversionMode and your output is interlaced, your frame rate is one of 23.97, 24, 25, 29.97, 50, or 60, your SegmentDuration is null, and you are using one of the resolution changes from the list below, Elastic Transcoder applies the following color space conversions:    Standard to HD, 720x480 to 1920x1080 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt601ToBt709     Standard to HD, 720x576 to 1920x1080 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt601ToBt709     HD to Standard, 1920x1080 to 720x480 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt709ToBt601     HD to Standard, 1920x1080 to 720x576 - Elastic Transcoder applies Bt709ToBt601     Elastic Transcoder may change the behavior of the ColorspaceConversionMode Auto mode in the future. All outputs in a playlist must use the same ColorSpaceConversionMode.  If you do not specify a ColorSpaceConversionMode, Elastic Transcoder does not change the color space of a file. If you are unsure what ColorSpaceConversionMode was applied to your output file, you can check the AppliedColorSpaceConversion parameter included in your job response. If your job does not have an AppliedColorSpaceConversion in its response, no ColorSpaceConversionMode was applied.  ChromaSubsampling  The sampling pattern for the chroma (color) channels of the output video. Valid values include yuv420p and yuv422p.  yuv420p samples the chroma information of every other horizontal and every other vertical line, yuv422p samples the color information of every horizontal line and every other vertical line.  LoopCount (Gif Only)  The number of times you want the output gif to loop. Valid values include Infinite and integers between 0 and 100, inclusive.

        /// The bit rate of the video stream in the output file, in kilobits/second. Valid values depend on the values of Level and Profile. If you specify auto, Elastic Transcoder uses the detected bit rate of the input source.

Watermarks can be in .png or .jpg format. If you want to display a watermark that is not rectangular, use the .png format, which supports transparency. When you create a job that uses this preset, you specify the .png or .jpg graphics that you want Elastic Transcoder to include in the transcoded videos.

For HLSv3 format playlists, each media segment is stored in a separate .ts file. For HLSv4 and Smooth playlists, all media segments for an output are stored in a single file. Each segment is approximately the length of the SegmentDuration, though individual segments might be shorter or longer. The range of valid values is 1 to 60 seconds. If the duration of the video is not evenly divisible by SegmentDuration, the duration of the last segment is the remainder of total length/SegmentDuration. Elastic Transcoder creates an output-specific playlist for each output HLS output that you specify in OutputKeys. To add an output to the master playlist for this job, include it in the OutputKeys of the associated playlist.
